2025-07-21T00:15:37.116892,8080,24215,1231,313,TCP,0.72,Suspicious Port Activity,"The use of non-standard ports (e.g., 24215) may indicate unauthorized access or malicious communication attempts. Additionally, the packet size of 1231 bytes is slightly above average and could be a sign of encapsulated payload data."
2025-07-21T00:15:51.763018,8080,18662,1487,161,UDP,0.0,LLM_ERROR,"Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 600 (char 599)"
2025-07-21T00:15:53.653333,8080,46227,1386,225,TCP,0.75,Unusually Large Packet,"The packet size of 1386 bytes is larger than typical network traffic, which could indicate potential data exfiltration or unauthorized file transfer."

2025-07-21T00:18:31.599628,8080,11993,139,201,UDP,0.8,Unusual UDP Port Activity,"The use of a high destination port (11993) with UDP protocol may indicate potential malware or unauthorized communication, as this port is not typically used for standard network services."
2025-07-21T00:18:55.349266,8080,55109,1102,315,UDP,0.8,Unusually Large UDP Packet,"The packet size of 1102 bytes is larger than typical UDP packets, which could indicate potential malware or unauthorized data transfer. The use of a high destination port (55109) may also suggest non-standard or suspicious activity."
2025-07-21T00:19:30.881005,8080,61902,379,163,TCP,0.7,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The destination port 61902 is not a standard port and is rarely used for common TCP services, which could indicate potential malicious activity or unauthorized access attempts. The source port 8080 is sometimes used as an alternative HTTP port, but the combination with this destination port is unusual."
2025-07-21T00:19:50.617122,22,57167,1302,57,TCP,0.8,Unusual SSH Outbound Traffic,"The source port 22 is typically used for incoming SSH connections, but in this case, it's being used as the source port for an outbound connection to a high-numbered destination port, which could indicate a potential SSH tunneling or misuse of the SSH protocol."

2025-07-21T00:20:22.214829,22,57208,1397,480,UDP,0.8,Unusual UDP Port Usage,The use of UDP protocol on a source port typically associated with SSH (port 22) and a high packet size is unusual and may indicate a potential scan or exploit attempt.
2025-07-21T00:20:41.416016,80,54625,1448,4119,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The source port 80 is typically used for HTTP traffic, but the destination port 54625 is unconventional, suggesting potential malicious activity or unauthorized access. The large packet size and prolonged duration may also indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized data transfer."
2025-07-21T00:20:43.855284,6666,63682,936,213,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The source port 6666 is often associated with IRC (Internet Relay Chat) services, but the destination port 63682 is a high-numbered port, which could indicate a potential backdoor or unauthorized access attempt. The large packet size of 936 bytes may also suggest a data transfer that is not typical for standard IRC communications."
2025-07-21T00:20:58.365686,8080,37086,1371,199,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Packet Size,"The packet size of 1371 bytes is larger than typical TCP packets, which could indicate potential data exfiltration or malicious file transfer, especially given the non-standard destination port 37086."
2025-07-21T00:21:01.218210,80,62198,1467,481,TCP,0.8,Potential Data Exfiltration,"The large packet size of 1467 bytes from a common source port (80, typically used for HTTP) to a high destination port (62198) could indicate unauthorized data transfer, possibly as a result of a malware infection or a malicious insider."
2025-07-21T00:21:09.374233,8080,21115,423,416,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The use of source port 8080, typically associated with HTTP proxy servers or alternative HTTP ports, to destination port 21115, which is not a standard service port, suggests potential unauthorized access or malicious activity. The relatively large packet size and moderate duration also contribute to the anomaly."
2025-07-21T00:21:26.608510,80,60604,129,445,TCP,0.8,Unusual High-Port Activity,"The destination port 60604 is a high, non-standard port, which could indicate potential backdoor or malware activity, especially given the relatively small packet size and short duration, suggesting possible command and control communication."
2025-07-21T00:21:33.933229,8080,45001,1401,479,UDP,0.8,Unusual UDP Packet Size,"The packet size of 1401 bytes is larger than typical UDP packets, which could indicate potential data exfiltration or unauthorized communication, especially given the non-standard destination port 45001."
2025-07-21T00:21:48.022441,8080,61657,776,297,UDP,0.8,Unusual UDP Port Combination,"The use of a high destination port (61657) in combination with a commonly used source port (8080) for UDP traffic is uncommon and may indicate potential scanning or exploit attempts, as UDP is often used for scanning and exploit activities due to its connectionless nature."
2025-07-21T00:21:51.382782,8080,18894,1304,220,TCP,0.7,Unusual Port Combination,"The use of a non-standard destination port (18894) in combination with a commonly used source port (8080) for TCP traffic may indicate a potential scanning or probing attempt, as 8080 is often associated with HTTP alternate ports and 18894 is not a standard port for common services."
2025-07-21T00:21:53.856042,6666,62277,964,285,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The source port 6666 is often associated with IRC (Internet Relay Chat) services, but the destination port 62277 is a high-numbered port, which could indicate a potential backdoor or unauthorized service. The large packet size of 964 bytes may also be an attempt to exfiltrate data or establish a covert channel."
2025-07-21T00:22:10.007247,80,15666,140,2376,TCP,0.8,Unusual Destination Port Activity,"The destination port 15666 is not a standard port for common TCP services, and traffic from a typical web server port (80) to this port is uncommon, suggesting potential unauthorized access or malicious activity."
2025-07-21T00:22:30.376909,80,64312,1359,2953,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Packet Size,"The packet size of 1359 bytes is larger than typical TCP packets, which could indicate potential data exfiltration or malicious file transfer. The source port 80 suggests a possible web server exploitation."
2025-07-21T00:31:34.081668,8080,11260,298,468,UDP,0.8,Unusual UDP Port Combination,"The use of a non-standard destination port (11260) in combination with a commonly used source port (8080) for UDP traffic may indicate a potential scanning or reconnaissance attempt, as this port combination is not typically seen in normal network traffic."
2025-07-21T00:32:16.383635,8080,2343,505,52,TCP,0.8,Unusual TCP Port Combination,"The combination of source port 8080, typically used for HTTP proxying or alternative HTTP services, and destination port 2343, a non-standard port, is uncommon and may indicate unauthorized access or malicious activity."
